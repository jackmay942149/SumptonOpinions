        <h1>THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD AND SCOTT MORRISON</h1>
        <h2>The media’s selective outrage when it comes to the 30th Prime Minister</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 19/03/2024</h3>

        <p>ScoMo is in a pretty interesting PR pickle at the moment, mostly stirred up by the mainstream media.</p>
        <p>The media propaganda machine consistently defended the tyrannical overreach dished out by the state premiers during COVID times as oppression for the greater good.</p>
        <p>Once it was all over though, and Australians had mostly moved forward from being oppressed by the self appointed COVID overlords, it came out that the Prime Minister during the COVID era had appointed himself extra ministries as a precautionary measure.</p>
        <p>Considering the mainstream media had previously supported Australians being forced to stay within their own homes, mass-business shutdowns, and the loss of livelihoods for those who don’t get injected with an experimental drug, you’d think they’d support a few extra responsibilities for the Prime Minister, right?</p>
        <p>WRONG! IT WAS OUTRAGE!</p>
        <p>Selective outrage, of course… BUT STILL, OUTRAGE!</p>
        <p>The media was furious and many Australians fell hook, line, and sinker for it.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Since the exaggerated ministries nonsense, Mr Morrison has been a fairly controversial figure for his minor change in responsibilities. On the other hand, state premiers who caused previously unimaginable pain to the Australian economy skip around relatively freely, without public upset.</p>
        <p>ScoMo has since been mingling with highly intelligent people who are immune to the deceitful media.</p>
        <p>From his iconic photo with world-renowned psychologist and author Professor Jordan Peterson to his more recent open connection with former Vice President Mike Pence, there is a real unification of world intellectuals happening.</p>
        <p>Who has Mr Morrison been most closely opening up about his connection with though?</p>
        <p>God.</p>

        <br>

        <p>ScoMo will be releasing his book called “Plans for your Good: A Prime Minister’s Testimony of God’s Faithfulness” on the 1st of May.</p>
        <p>He took to the social media platform “X” to state “Looking forward to Plans for Your Good being released in May,” with publishing details and a link to pre-order.</p>
        <p>The reaction from leftists has been negative as expected, but the response from conservatives has also been mostly negative online.</p>
        <p>Conservatives are too busy launching attacks at the leader about COVID rulings to focus on what’s really important.</p>
        <p>Mr Morrison is one of the only world leaders putting God first.</p>
        <p>He is making sure God is in the spotlight.</p>
        <p>The former PM’s journey with God should be supported.</p>
        <p>If you are not excited about Scott Morrison’s prioritisation of Christianity while he moves away from a political career, then you’re not a true Christian, and would have a hard time justifying yourself as a conservative.</p>
        <p>God is the most important topic in the world.</p>
        <p>That is what matters most.</p>
