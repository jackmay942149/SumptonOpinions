        <h1>TITANIC II WILL KILL WOKE CULTURE</h1>
        <h2>"Palmer wants to bring people together, especially after the government’s brutal attempts to divide us through COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 13/07/2024</h3>

        <p>In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Australian national treasure Clive Palmer discussed how the completion of his upcoming ocean liner, Titanic II will be an antidote to “woke” culture.</p>
        <p>Mr Palmer has invested many years and many millions of dollars into the construction of Titanic II, which will be a functional modern-day replica of the original world-renowned Titanic.</p>
        <p>Since the viral 60 Minutes Australia Interview around a decade ago, anticipation for the upcoming Blue Star Line-owned vessel has remained high.</p>
        <p>Much of the excitement surrounding the ship is due to Clive Palmer’s involvement and the cultural implications Titanic II could have on Australia, and the world more broadly.</p>

        <br>

        <p>While multi-billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have their interests in space exploration and technology, Clive Palmer is investing in what the world will always need with or without tech, compassion and values.</p>
        <p>Palmer wants to bring people together, especially after the government’s brutal attempts to divide us through COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates.</p>
        <p>The name of his political party “United Australia” might have given that away.</p>
        <p>During Mr Palmer’s Rolling Stone interview he said, “Doesn’t matter whether you’re on the moon or you’re going to Mars, right? You still meet people, you still need to respect them.</p>
        <p>You still need to value that sort of human relationship.</p>
        <p>I think one of our problems in our society (is) that we don’t value that sense.”</p>
        <p>While other billionaires and billion-dollar corporations are working towards transhumanism (the goal of replacing our brains and bodies with cybernetic silicon based systems and mechanical bodies), the Australian mining magnate’s goals represent human connection.</p>
        <p>On the Titanic II, people will remember those lost on the original ship and the selflessness they exuded when they went down with it.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Late last month, I saw Clive Palmer and political commentator Tucker Carlson live in Cairns.</p>
        <p>It was an amazing show and I even got to meet the great Senator Babet who was among the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mr Carlson is a brilliant speaker and a true American entertainer.</p>
        <p>He had the whole entertainment centre laughing and cheering.</p>
        <p>That was to be expected given the worldwide popularity of the former Fox News host.</p>
        <p>What the mainstream media would have hated the most though, is how Clive Palmer made everyone in attendance enthusiastic about the Titanic II, and how it will help kill woke culture.</p>
        <p>A whole new generation of people were cheering for the ocean liner and what it represents.</p>
        <p>The 70-year-old billionaire brought hope to the crowd for a true Australian project.</p>
        <p>I cannot wait to hop aboard when it’s completed, and neither can many Australians.</p>
