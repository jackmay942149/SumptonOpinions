        <h1>ALBANESE SHOULD RESIGN FOR HIS DISGRACEFUL RESPONSE TO THE ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION OF TRUMP.</h1>
        <h2>"To vaguely describe a President being shot as an “incident” is to minimize a historic attempted killing on purpose."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 15/07/2024</h3>

        <p>Almost everybody has now seen the video where a bullet whizzed past Donald Trump’s head, hitting his ear.</p>
        <p>Despite a violent activist shooting the former President on camera, Donald Trump stood up with a bloodied face and threw his fist in the air to show that he won’t back down.</p>
        <p>In a moment of grave danger and while the secret service tried to drag him away, Trump made sure to show the world how unfazed he is by the violent intolerant left.</p>
        <p>His courageous act will not be forgotten, and it will be heavily detailed in the history books.</p>
        <p>The divisive acts of far-left politicians and activists, many of whom reside in Australia, have made uneducated radicals think that violence and guns are acceptable to use on political adversaries.</p>
        <p>Thank God their pathetic rhetoric which inspired violence failed to kill the President, although sadly it did kill and injure innocent bystanders in the crowd near Trump.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Many important Australian political figures made appropriate and truthful statements in response to the attempted assassination on Trump.</p>
        <p>Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated, “It’s never right to try to settle a political argument with a gun.</p>
        <p>"After the shooting of President Trump, everyone should remember that in a stable democracy the things that unite us are always more important than anything that divides us.</p>
        <p>"Meanwhile, thank God he’s not seriously hurt.”</p>
        <p>Victorian Senator Ralph Babet also made an appropriate statement by announcing, “What we do know is that Joe Biden, the media, and the celebrities who charged the atmosphere with overblown rhetoric - calling him a dictator, a threat to America and a fascist - encouraged this assassination attempt.</p>
        <p>Trump’s blood, America's blood, is on their hands.</p>
        <p>It was Joe Biden after all who, less than a week ago, said: ‘It’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.’</p>
        <p>I pray for my American friends in this difficult time, and I pray for Donald J. Trump and the family and friends of the supporters who were killed and injured at the rally.”</p>

        <br>

        <p>While political figures as the ones previously mentioned made bold, truthful, and heartfelt statements, our Prime Minister Anthony Albanese embarrassed himself and Australia.</p>
        <p>Albanese minimized the attempted assassination and wounding of a President as simply an “incident” which was “concerning and confronting.”</p>
        <p>Albanese made no mention of a shooting, attempted killing, or the death that took place in the crowd nearby Trump</p>
        <p>His response was pathetic and disgusting.</p>
        <p>While the 45th President of the United States showed he is brave and bold, Albanese showed that he does not value the truth and would rather lie by omission of what really happened.</p>
        <p>To vaguely describe a President being shot as an “incident” is to minimize a historic attempted killing on purpose.</p>
        <p>Albanese must resign for his lack of value for human life and disinterest in creating unity in such tumultuous times.</p>
