        <h1>AMBER ROSE CHANGED AMERICAN POLITICS FOREVER.</h1>
        <h2>"Amber Rose’s pro-Trump speech changed politics forever."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 22/07/2024</h3>

        <p>The 2024 Republican National Convention (RNC), where former President Donald Trump was made the official Republican candidate for the 2024 Presidential Election had a lot of star-studded moments.</p>
        <p>Coming off the attempted assassination of the former President, there were high expectations going into the event.</p>
        <p>Many great moments pumped up voters at the RNC, but it may be most fondly noted in the history books for former wrestler Hulk Hogan’s fiery endorsement of Donald Trump.</p>
        <p>In the energetic on-stage endorsement, The Hulkster ripped his shirt apart to reveal his pro-Trump singlet underneath while yelling, “When they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next President of the United States, enough was enough! I said let Trumpamania run wild, brother!” Other notable moments included performances from Kid Rock and Lee Greenwood.</p>
        <p>UFC CEO Dana White also made an endorsement of the former President, but perhaps the most important moment came from a celebrity that may have flown under the radar of most typical conservatives and Republicans.</p>
        <p>Amber Rose’s pro-Trump speech changed politics forever.</p>
        
        <br>

        <p>You may have no idea who Amber Rose is.</p>
        <p>That is completely understandable.</p>
        <p>Amber Rose is like a Kardashian, it’s hard to explain how or why she became famous, and it’s even harder to justify whether or not she should be famous.</p>
        <p>Whatever you may think of her fame, the fact of the matter is that she IS famous.</p>
        <p>With nearly 25 MILLION followers on the photo and video sharing app Instagram, Ms. Rose skyrocketed to fame through her modelling career with brands like Louis Vuitton as well as through high profile relationships such as to rapper Kanye West and NBA Player Terrence Ross.
        <p>She was also briefly married to rapper Wiz Khalifa.</p>
        <p>Young women have gravitated towards her for her women’s rights advocacy, and she even starred in her own American talk show called “The Amber Rose Show,” which was executively produced by the famous Dr. Phil.</p>
        <p>Her mainstream relevance and appeal to younger voters cannot be understated.</p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Amber Rose’s speech at the 2024 Republican National Convention impactfully spoke to young voters, while also appealing to a wider audience who may be unfamiliar with the famous model.</p>
        <p>She kicked off the speech with inspiring words about being a parent.</p>
        <p>“My name is Amber Rose.</p>
        <p>"I am a model and entrepreneur, but most importantly I’m a mother.</p>
        <p>"My whole world revolves around providing for my children, keeping them safe, and giving them an opportunity for a better life.</p>
        <p>"That’s something that unites all American parents whether we are Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, or Liberals.</p>
        <p>"We all want a better country for our children.</p>
        <p>"But I am here tonight to tell you, that no matter your political background, the best chance we have to give our babies a better life is to elect Donald Trump President of the United States.”</p>
        <p>This part of her speech will be circling around the internet for years to come.</p>
        <p>Many parts from her speech have already been seen by tens of millions of people around the world, but her most viral moment is when she said the following.</p>
        <p>“I realised Donald Trump and his supporters don’t care if you’re black, white, gay, or straight.</p>
        <p>"It’s all love.</p>
        <p>"And that’s when it hit me, these are my people, this is where I belong.”</p>
