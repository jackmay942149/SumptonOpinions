        <h1>THE LEFTIST ASSAULT ON RURAL LIVING</h1>
        <h2>"In reality, the mainstream media are using racist underhanded tactics to ignite a race war and also encourage hatred of people in the outback."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 15/08/2023</h3>

        <p>The new country song “Try That in A Small Town,” by Jason Aldean has over 1.1 million likes on YouTube compared to less than 95 thousand dislikes.</p>
        <p>It has also recently experienced the largest sales week for any country song in around a decade.</p>
        <p>Despite these fantastic numbers, the media are hellbent on trying to convince you there is some kind of controversy surrounding the track.</p>
        <p>In reality, the mainstream media are using racist underhanded tactics to ignite a race war and also encourage hatred of people in the outback.</p>
        <p>In the lyrics of “Try That in A Small Town,” criminal behaviour such as sucker punching, carjacking, spitting in the face of law enforcement, and using guns illegally are condemned by the artist, who says the behaviour would not fly in a small town.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact any normal person would completely agree with the song’s lyrics, it has been labelled by many in the American and Australian media as “racist” and “controversial.”</p>
        <p>The Australian news platform Countrytown claimed the song was accused of “racist dog whistling.”</p>
        <p>Leftist Journalists have been working overtime to create controversy out of the song because they are obsessed with connecting criminal behaviour to non-white people, a deeply racist but sadly common thing for them to do.</p>
        <p>They want to trick people into a race war but most people see right through it</p>
        <p>Jason Aldean never mentioned race in the hit track, the leftist media have completely made up that race is connected.</p>
        <p>The media have also used the release of the song to attack small towns and people living in them.</p>
        <p>In The Guardian article titled “Musicians like Jason Aldean love to glorify ‘small-town’ America.</p>
        <p>It’s embarrassing” by Jill Filipovic, she writes, “Small-town America can be cruel, brutish and exclusionary.</p>
        <p>And cities are the United States’ beating hearts.”</p>
        <p>She also wrote, “Despite Aldean’s claims, small towns, it seems, are not doing all that great when it comes to taking care of their own.”</p>
        <p>These are clearly wild and hate-fuelled claims looking to encourage division.</p>
        <p>In the last sentence of her laughable article, she makes the claim, “It’s American cities that represent the best of American values.”</p>
        <p>With ridiculous articles such as the one mentioned by Jill Filipovic, the leftist mob reveal they are not interested in peace, only encouraging hatred.</p>
        <p>They want hatred against races, against places, and against the individuals that belong to them.</p>
