        <h1>THE ESTABLISHMENT IS TRYING TO ERADICATE "MEN"</h1>
        <h2>"The hate and censorship only goes in one direction."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 01/09/2023</h3>

        <p>On the 20th of February this year, SBS reported Roald Dahl books are being changed to get rid of “offensive” language, stating “following consultation with sensitivity readers, publishers Puffin and the Roald Dahl Story Company (acquired by streaming service Netflix in 2021) have made a series of changes throughout the books to remove language deemed offensive or insensitive to modern audiences.”</p>
        <p>For example, a description of the Oompa Loompas has been changed to be more “gender-neutral.”</p>
        <p>They are now described as “small people” instead of “small men.”</p>
        <p>While words like “men” are being deemed too inappropriate in classics for the modern age, books which are heavily marketed toward young individuals are freely available in Australian bookstores such as “Queer Chameleon and Friends,” which was recently released.</p>
        <p>The book’s author lives in Australia and receives high praise in literature groups.</p>
        <p>The official Instagram page for the “Queer Chameleon,” recently released a statement on their page stating, “going to drag shows doesn’t ‘make’ kids gay,’ defending individuals who choose to take their children to drag shows.</p>
        <p>Videos plastered all over the internet of men dressed up as women while dancing in a sexual manner around children show how blatantly perverted such an activity is.</p>
        <p>This is even a highly controversial topic among individuals within the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
        <p>Despite this, someone in Australia can proudly publish cartoons like this to high praise by the establishment.</p>
        <p>The reason why books like Roald Dahl’s are being wrongfully changed in the name of “sensitivity” is not because the establishment actually wants to be more sensitive.</p>
        <p>It is because publishers want to receive praise for pandering to the far left who want to limit the amount of exposure children get toward stories referencing a large group of men, unless there is a sexual reference involved.</p>
        <p>There certainly was no shortage or discouragement toward the vast majority of books with “women” in the title during International Women’s Day.</p>
        <p>The hate and censorship only goes in one direction.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day when the societal phase of hating men in the media ends, these publishers will only be known as hateful bigots who hated men and wrongfully censored books they should never have touched.</p>
