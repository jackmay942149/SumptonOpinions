        <h1>AUSTRALIA NEEDS MORE POLITICIANS LIKE RALPH BABET</h1>
        <h2>"Australia has been plunged into a cost of living crisis, an energy crisis, and a housing crisis by Labor."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 11/12/2023</h3>
        
        <p>Despite being the only member representing the United Australia Party in the Senate, Ralph Babet has been more productive than any single Labor or LNP Senator I have ever heard of.</p>
        <p>Babet has been publicly thanked by former President Donald Trump for his dedication to freedom, he has written some of the most important articles ever published for Spectator Australia, and he has grilled the CEO of Qantas for all the company’s misdeeds by asking questions major parties are afraid to.</p>
        <p>His most recent display of bravery and productiveness may be my favourite though, as he gave Australian politicians one of the most important Christmas messages in history.</p>
        <p>A snippet from Victorian Senator Ralph Babet’s Christmas message to Australian politicians:</p>
        <p>“Many of you spend your time demonising coal but we wouldn’t have a Christmas if it wasn’t for coal. Indeed, we wouldn’t have anything were it not for coal.</p>
        <p>"If we were to stop using coal, as many in this place insist that we must, our country would grind to a halt.</p>
        <p>"Coal powers our country, everything from our lights to our budget surplus is thanks to the miracle of cheap, abundant coal.” </p>
        <p>Babet hit the nail on the head.</p>
        <p>Australia has been plunged into a cost of living crisis, an energy crisis, and a housing crisis by Labor.</p>
        <p>We need Australian politicians who understand that opening coal-fired power stations will save Australia.</p>
        <p>The rate at which countries like China, India, or America use coal-fired power stations will NEVER compare to Australia even if we tried.</p>
        <p>Our population simply doesn’t compare to the energy demand in other nations. So, by limiting our coal usage, we are only shooting ourselves in the foot, and we save nobody.</p>
        <p>The climate cult which seeps into our parliament is destroying Australia for nothing.</p>
        <p>Ralph Babet and the United Australia Party are becoming one of the only options to save Australia.</p>
        <p>Peter “do nothing” Dutton and David “Net Zero" Littleproud can barely be recognised as something resembling an “opposition” at this point.</p>
        <p>Mr Babet has become so renowned as a profound truth teller, that despite being the single representing member for his party in the senate, far-left ideologues obsess over him on social media.</p>
        <p>They viciously attack him on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>When a single man can garner such hate from Australia’s most intellectually challenged population, the wokies, you know he is one of the most important truth tellers of the nation.</p>
        <p>Australia needs a backbone and somebody who knows how to stop our country from its rapid decline.</p>
        <p>Australia needs Ralph Babet.</p>
