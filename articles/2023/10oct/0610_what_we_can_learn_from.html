        <h1>WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM STEVEN SEAGAL</h1>
        <h2>"The media hates Steven Seagal for the same reason it does Nickelback, John Wayne, Creed, and other figures, because the profound masculinity makes modern generations uncomfortable."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 06/10/2023</h3>
        
        <p>Steven Seagal is one of the most successful actors of all time, a 7th-dan black belt in aikido, the Special Representative for Russia-US cultural Links, as well as a published writer, musician, producer, and many other things.</p>
        <p>Most people never reach anything close to his rare combination of impressive achievements yet it is not uncommon to hear westerners look down on him as unimportant or at the very least one-dimensional.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Steven Seagal is the perfect representation of competence.</p>
        <p>There are few who have the discipline and engrained masculinity to outshine the way the Under Siege actor does, so why is there such persistence to ridicule him in the modern media sphere?</p>
        <p>The war is not simply against Seagal, but against masculinity on a broader scale.</p>
        <p>The media hates Steven Seagal for the same reason it does Nickelback, John Wayne, Creed, and other figures, because the profound masculinity makes modern generations uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>In the new age of incompetence, where people are not disciplined and find the idea of “being a man” insulting, they loathe men who are representations of everything they can’t be due to their toxic ideology.</p>
        <p>Who has time to be a master of Aikido and make some of the most successful movies of all time when you are scrolling through social media all day and complaining to your friends about how offensive masculine men are?</p>
        <p>We are facing a total deterioration of society where everything is continually getting a little bit worse again and again.</p>
        <p>Qantas has become known for flight delays or cancellations and airlines as well as other large operations will continue to worsen so long as we live in an undisciplined society which has no pride in work westerners might consider “menial.”</p>
        <p>But if it is so menial, why can’t it be done right? Without discipline, without masculine men, without effort, there is just the incompetent society we are more so becoming everyday.</p>
        <p>Take a vacation to Brisbane and see how long it takes for people to prepare your hotel room or bring you food or even get a taxi.</p>
        <p>It was once considered outrageous for these tasks to be prolonged hours at a time but now that’s just part of living in our deteriorated world.</p>
        <p>So I ask you, in a world full of weak losers, be a Steven Seagal.</p>
