        <h1>THE HARSH REALITY ABOUT THE NEWS</h1>
        <h2>"TWO of the four previous Prime Ministers have been LIED ABOUT constantly."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 21/07/2023</h3>
        
        <h2>Part 1: Extremism within the mainstream media</h4>

        <p>Part 1 was originally published as “How the Australian media tries to turn you on your friends and family.”</p>
        <p>According to a major study conducted by a senior academic at the University of the Sunshine Coast with over 600 surveyees, over 40 per cent of ABC journalists support the Greens and over 30 per cent support Labor.</p>
        <p>Additionally, more than half of ABC’s staff operate in Ultimo NSW, which is heavily populated by Greens voters, (so much for “national” representation).</p>
        <p>Sadly, these facts are why many ordinary people find themselves taking extremist positions on topics they rely on the ABC (and other outlets, which are typically even more radical), to give them the correct information for.</p>
        <p>The media is largely run by activists who want to drag ordinary people into holding extremist views by isolating all other ideas.</p>
        <p>I always advocate for people to read the news instead of watching it because it’s easier to pick out glaring inconsistencies and political bias.</p>
        <p>In most recent years, many in the media have led an extremist assault on small-l liberals and conservatives, attempting to push ordinary people into isolating their family, friends and acquaintances alike who hold freedom or small government as paramount by branding them as “far-right.”
        <p>In fact, in many instances the media positioning attempts to lead people into the belief that ANY view other than the one outlined by broadcasting tyrants as righteous is an unacceptable belief to hold.</p>
        <p>The strategy of this is to move the goalpost of what makes a standard “Liberal” further to the extremist side so that ALL to the right of that worldview is “far-right.”</p>
        <p>A great example of this is the attack on the classical liberals of the 1990’s.</p>
        <p>President Bill Clinton was once a liberal hero.</p>
        <p>He was the man who broke the mould of the Raegan-Bush conservatism line and brought liberalism back into the forefront.</p>
        <p>These days though, his famous statement that “abortion should be safe, legal, and rare,” would not suit a modern day leftist.</p>
        <p>It would be considered too stigmatised, and holders of that belief would be outcast by the average University dwelling advocate.</p>
        <p>This unethical way of operating many elements of the Australian media acts as a prong for extremist advocates alongside big tech.</p>
        <p>A great example of this is Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>If there is someone the extreme media doesn’t like, they churn out slurs against the person, calling them things such as far-right, (far-right is a purposely ambiguous term which makes falsely branded victims unable to sue), then big tech operations like Wikipedia use those media outlets as sources to falsey brand someone with that term, so it’s the first thing you see when you search their name online.</p>
        <p>Then, if they are ever referenced to an ordinary person, said individual will search their name and reject any statement made by them because Big Tech have labelled them someone who is not to be listened to.</p>
        <p>A great question to ask someone poisoned with ideology and branding everyone they disagree with as “far-right” is, “Give me a list of people who are conservative who you do not label as far-right but simply an ordinary conservative?” They will not have a good answer for you because they consider all conservatism as unacceptable.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: The word “controversial” is killing freedom.</h4>

        <p>When the Albanese government splattered egg on its face by forcing President Trump’s son to postpone his speaking tour by mishandling his visa application, the term “controversial speaker” was thrown around by the media.</p>
        <p>The term was thrown around almost as if our government’s incompetence was justified because the person set to arrive in Australia was “controversial.” Donald Trump Jr, a constant best selling author and son of a man who is often considered the most famous living in the world, is first and foremost…controversial?</p>
        <p>Nope.</p>
        <p>Do not let the minority mob tell you that a man who puts FREEDOM first is “controversial.”</p>

        <p>TWO of the four previous Prime Ministers have been LIED ABOUT constantly.</p>

        <p>Sadly, the mainstream media has been working overtime to cast the wet cardboard cutout that is Scott Morrison, as  a super villian much like how they have tried to make President Trump out to be.</p>
        <p>The government funded ABC News made a social media post on Twitter (they later deleted it), containing an article which claims that a life with the “Pentecostal Church,” which Scott Morrison is closely connected to, is “at odds” with “genuine expression.”</p>
        <p>The media has constantly stuck the term “controversy” or “controversial” with Scott Morrison’s name.</p>
        <p>Not to mention former Prime Minister Tony Abbott who was outright labelled as “Australia’s controversial ex-Prime MInister” by the Geelong Advertiser and constantly lied about.</p>
        <p>Two of the four ex-Prime Ministers of Australia have supposedly become “controversial figures.” despite both being voted in by everyday Australians under 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>If the Australian mainstream media are hellbent on turning Australia’s leaders they don’t like into “controversial” or “disliked” people, imagine what they are doing to commendable, incredible, and hard working Australians every single day.</p>
