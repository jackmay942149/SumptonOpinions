        <h1>AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE HAS BEEN THROWN INTO QUESTION DUE TO SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS</h1>
        <h2>"There can be an important lesson learned from this never ending series of Australia being thrown into uncertainty due to unprofessional decisions and comments."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 10/07/2023</h3>

        <p>The Albanese government can almost entirely be defined by its blatant unprofessionalism and poor management of international relations so far.</p>
        <p>From the government’s disgusting treatment of Israel and China to constant snubbing of the U.K, it pushes nations away like a catty teenager.</p>
        <p>In the newest showcase of juvenile behaviour from our increasingly embarrassing federal ministers, Donald Trump Jr was forced to postpone his speaking tour in Australia after his visa application was held up for longer than usual.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the Australian home affairs minister attacked Jr in now deleted social media posts as a “big baby who isn’t very popular.”</p>
        <p>Donald Trump Jr has now put the Australian government on blast to the world for peddling fake news and being a part of the tyrannical Left.</p>
        <p>Jr directly called out the home affairs minister in the now viral statement, “If Minister Clare O’Neil isn’t too much of a coward to leave her left-wing safe space, I’d be happy to invite her to attend any of the events we put on. You never know; maybe she’ll learn a thing or two about the importance of freedom of speech and diversity of thought.”</p>

        <p>The Australian government’s poor handling of a high profile person’s visa and unprofessional minister has resulted in an internationally observed call out.</p>
        <p>Australia additionally will have to navigate its history of unprofessionalism toward the U.S when a Republican returns to the oval office.</p>
        <p>If our federal minister had just refrained from behaving like a teenager tweeting toward her high school enemy and done her job instead, none of this would have happened.</p>
        <p>No matter what side of the spectrum someone is on, they understand that hard working Australians do not want to be concerned with whether or not their country’s bond with another could be shattered by an unprofessional minister calling people names through tweets.</p>
        <p>There can be an important lesson learned from this never ending series of  Australia being thrown into uncertainty due to unprofessional decisions and comments.</p>
        <p>If Gen Z and inner-city voters had understood the difference between having political priorities based on being young, and voting in politicians who behave like juveniles, this could have been reduced.</p>
        <p>Hopefully this is something young voters can understand before voting in the next election.</p>
        <p>It is okay to have different priorities as a young Australian than other age groups, it is not okay to elect individuals who behave like stereotypical teenagers.</p>
