        <h1>AUSTRALIANS NEED TO SUPPORT TRUTH SOCIAL</h1>
        <h2>"It is important Australians who support free speech gravitate to the platform."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 17/07/2023</h3>
        
        <p>The new social media platform Truth Social, founded by former U.S President Donald Trump is now available in Australia.</p>
        <p>The platform can be accessed on computers and you are also able to download Truth Social as an app on your smartphone.</p>
        <p>I have been surprised by how easy Truth Social is to navigate and how useful the platform is for connecting with smart, freedom loving Australians across all states and territories.</p>
        <p>The platform was trending on Twitter on the first day it was accessible in our nation and the group I created for the platform called “Australians for TRUTH” has been growing quickly.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most interestingly, the platform is the best way to directly read statements from the former U.S President Donald Trump as well as other famous intellectuals.</p>
        <p>It is important Australians who support free speech gravitate to the platform.</p>
        <p>There are many social media platforms which have pandered to conservatives and freedom lovers such as Gab and Parler but too often they lose frequent users and fail to truly innovate, leaving mostly anonymous radicals.</p>
        <p>Truth Social is full of frequent users as well as brilliant content creators you are going to want to follow like Dinesh D’Souza and Sebastian Gorka.</p>
        <p>I’m not advocating for people to abandon other platforms if they do not want to.</p>
        <p>I am only championing for Aussies to additionally use Truth Social.</p>
        <p>Online censorship of the truth has gone on for too long and we need to support platforms by people who put freedom first.</p>
        <p>Create your account and join the Truth Social group “Australians for TRUTH” founded by Daniel Sumpton.</p>
