        <h1>OUTBACK AUSTRALIA'S PROFOUND HISTORY WITH ISRAEL</h1>
        <h2>"The Albanese government has waged war on religious values and respect, plain and simple."</h2>
        <h3>Daniel Sumpton - 25/11/2022</h3>

        <p>Before and during World War II, there was serious consideration for the Kimberley in Australia to become a place where European Jewish people facing rampant anti-Semitism could go as a new Jewish haven.</p>
        <p>If not for the white Australia policy, which was a key factor in the federal government ultimately shooting the proposal down, Australia could have saved an unfathomable amount of Jewish lives from the atrocities of the holocaust.</p>
        <p>This part of Australian history is one example that highlights the mateship outback Australians have with the Jewish people, even when the federal government has other plans.</p>
        <p>Recently, the Albanese government reversed Australia’s decision to recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.</p>
        <p>This resulted in criticism from the Israeli Prime Minister at the time, Yair Lapid, who called foreign minister Penny Wong’s decision unprofessional, marking yet another stain on Penny Wong’s terrible run as foreign minister.</p>
        <p>Penny Wong’s rushed and uneducated decision was also praised by terrorist group Hamas.</p>
        <p>President of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy Leibler said on the day of the announcement, “the decision today has been welcomed by Hamas - an organisation designated by the Australian Government as a terrorist organisation. That alone should cause the Albanese Government to reflect on this decision.”</p>
        <p>A Federal Labor Member even slammed Penny Wong for reversing the Coalition’s call on the capital, and was particularly disgusted by this decision being implemented during a holy day for the Jewish people.</p>
        <p>Governments that are voted in by outback Australians make decisions on the right side of history regarding Israel because they understand that rural and regional Australians respect the religious views of Jewish people and their history.</p>
        <p>The Albanese government has waged war on religious values and respect, plain and simple.</p>
